# Local Development

Use [predictionio-buildpack](README.md) to setup your local PredictionIO environment.

To do any real development work with PredictionIO, you'll need to run it locally. We'll use the [`bin/local/` scripts](https://github.com/heroku/predictionio-buildpack/tree/master/bin/local) to simplify that setup procedure and ensure parity between the dev (local) & production (Heroku).

## Background

This local dev technique sets up a complete installation of PredictionIO inside each engine you wish to work on. Each engine may have different configuration and dependencies, so the entire environment is contained within an engine directory.

## Supported Platforms

This workflow augments the Heroku/Linux-based deployment, and so only supports similar platforms:

### Works

* macOS ‚≠êÔ∏è **primary, best experience**
* Debian/Ubuntu Linux

### Should Work

* Linux via Docker or virtualization
* Windows 10 w/ Linux subsystem

### Not Working

* Windows MS/DOS or PowerShell
* mobile OSs

## How-to

### 0. Remove previously installed `pio`

If you previously used PredictionIO, then you might have added the `pio` command to the `PATH` of the shell. Setup will abort if `pio` already exists. Please remove any existing PredictionIO entries from the `PATH`. It may be set in  `~/.profile`, `~/.bash_profile`, or `~/.bashrc`.

### 1. Install Dependencies

‚ö†Ô∏è *This step is only required once for your computer.*

1. Install [Java/JDK 8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
1. Install [PostgreSQL 9.6](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and start it
   * for macOS, we üíú [Postgres.app](http://postgresapp.com)

### 2. The Buildpack

‚ö†Ô∏è *This step is only required once for your computer.*

```bash
# First, change directory up to your top-level projects.
cd ~/my/projects/

git clone https://github.com/heroku/predictionio-buildpack
cd predictionio-buildpack/

# Capture this directory's path for use in next steps.
export PIO_BUILDPACK_DIR="$(pwd)"
```

### 3. The Engine

‚ö†Ô∏è *This step is required for each local engine directory.*

With a few commands, we'll install PredictionIO & its dependencies into `./PredictionIO-dist/` and configure it all via env vars & rendered config files.

```bash
# First, change directory to the target engine:
cd ~/my/projects/engine-dir/

# Depending on the engine, an environment template may be available.
# Copy & edit it:
cp .env.local .env
#
# ‚Ä¶or create a new one:
echo 'PIO_EVENTSERVER_APP_NAME=my-engine' >> .env
echo 'PIO_POSTGRES_OPTIONAL_SSL=true'     >> .env

# Ignore the local dev artifacts
echo                      >> .gitignore
echo 'bin/pio'            >> .gitignore
echo 'bin/dotenv'         >> .gitignore
echo '.env'               >> .gitignore
echo 'PredictionIO-dist/' >> .gitignore
echo 'repo/'              >> .gitignore

# Setup this working directory:
$PIO_BUILDPACK_DIR/bin/local/setup
```

#### Refreshing the setup

‚ôªÔ∏è Run `bin/local/setup` whenever:

  * the buildpack is updated/moved
  * an environment variable (including the `.env` file) is changed that effects dependencies, like:
    * `PIO_S3_*` or
    * `PIO_ELASTICSEARCH_*`

Here's how:

```bash
# Capture the path to the buildpack on your machine (from Step 2.)
export PIO_BUILDPACK_DIR=~/my/projects/predictionio-buildpack

# Then, inside the engine to refresh:
$PIO_BUILDPACK_DIR/bin/local/setup

# Finally, verify the new setup is working; Postgres & optionally Elasticsearch must be running:
bin/pio status
```

If you encounter errors, it may be necessary to [reset the local development installation](#user-content-reset).

### 4. Postgres

1. Start Postgres
   * for **Postgres.app**, use the üêò menubar item to start the server
   * other installation methods have their own start-up process
1. Configure each engine to use its own database. The `.env` file should define the unique database connection like this:

   ‚úèÔ∏è *Replace `my_database_name` with a name for your engine's database.*

   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://pio@localhost/my_database_name
   PIO_POSTGRES_OPTIONAL_SSL=true
   ```
1. Create the Postgres user & database to match that configuration:

   ```bash
   createuser pio
   createdb my_database_name
   ```

   üëì These binary commands are [included with Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/reference-client.html). You may need to reference them directly from the database installation.


### 5. Elasticsearch (optional)

‚ö†Ô∏è *Only available if `PIO_ELASTICSEARCH_URL` is set during `bin/local/setup`.*

#### Configure Elasticsearch

1. In the engine, open `.env` file and add the default local address for ES:

    ```bash
    PIO_ELASTICSEARCH_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9200
    ```
    
1. [Refresh the setup](#user-content-refreshing-the-setup)

#### Run Elasticsearch

In a new terminal, from the engine's directory:

```bash
cd PredictionIO-dist/vendors/elasticsearch/
bin/elasticsearch
```

### 6. Finally, use `bin/pio`

```bash
bin/pio status
bin/pio app new my-engine-name
bin/pio build --verbose
# Importing data is required before training will succeed
bin/pio train -- --driver-memory 8G
bin/pio deploy
```

üëì the `bin/pio` command reads the local environment (config vars) from the local `.env` file everytime it's invoked.

#### Run Eventserver

In a new terminal, from the engine's directory:

```bash
bin/pio eventserver
```

## Deployment

‚ñ∂Ô∏è [How to deploy to Heroku](CUSTOM.md)


## Reset

If local dev seems broken, try clearing out the local install, and then reinstall.

üö® **This will result in destruction of local state contained in these directories.**

```bash
rm -rf PredictionIO-dist/ repo/
```

Then, [refresh the setup](#user-content-refreshing-the-setup).
